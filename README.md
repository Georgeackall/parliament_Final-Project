# Parliament

Parliament (theparliament.app) is an open source news project, which organizes news into *confidence*, *bias*, and *importance* in order to tell maximally truthful news. 

This project is *pre-release*, and as such is a preview. Many features are in development. 

## Whitepaper

Credible News

#Mission

Think about how you understand news. You may consume multiple news sources, and given how well you value the opinion of certain news outlets over others, you will either arrive a conclusion for what you think has happened, or consider yourself unsure. Implicitly, you are assining a judgement value to various news outlets, favoring the credibility of some over others. Once you have enough credible confirmations you may consider something to be effectively true. One aspect of this credibility scoring is *confidence*. Confidence is the likelihood of something being true based on how true it has been in the past. For us, our confidence in certain outlets is weighed by our *bias* towards the persona of that outlet. And finally, we get riled up by news that appear in large, bold headlines. *NIXON RESIGNS*, for example. This score we call *importance*.

Each human consumes news differently due to their different experiences. This is in large party why news is perceived so differently by different individuals. Parliament is focused on telling the most truthful news, and doing so in a clear and measurable way.
